Script utilities to be used as system commands

## Usage

### Method one

Download specific scripts from the ````scripts```` directory to your path.

### Method two

Clone this repository and run ````./install.sh [-p PATH] [-b] [SCRIPT1 [SCRIPT2]]````

Don't pass any scriptname for installing all scripts

Put ````source PATH/utilities.sh```` in your bash login script

````PATH```` is ````/usr/bin```` by default.
